# CapstoneTwo

_This project is a Heart Disease Prediction Model using a Ridge Classifier. This project is created to help determine if a patient is likely to have heart disease based on the given features and make an easier decision for more extensive heart testing_

# 1. Data

Combination of 5 different datasets found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)

# 2. Data Cleaning

# 3. EDA

[EDA Notebook](https://github.com/prem-0217/CapstoneTwo/blob/main/Notebooks/Heart%20EDA.ipynb)

# 4. Model

Using PyCaret, many models were tested before deciding to use a Ridge Classifier; the ridge classifier boasts the highest accuracy while also having a high recall / precision value.

# 5. Future Improvements

- More patient data
	- Possibly through synthetic data
- Merging with other sets for more features
